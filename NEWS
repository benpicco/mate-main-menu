  * Initial public upstream release.

  The gnome-main-menu consists mainly of three utilities.  A gnome-panel applet
  that is the main interface providing access to your favorite and recently
  used applications, documents and places. Also access to system status and
  common actions such as searching and logout / shutdown.

  Access to other applications is made via the application-browser â€“ providing
  interactive searching of the entire list of your applications, ordered for
  display by their menu categories.

  These higher level components as well as the shell in the gnome-control-center
  all use the common pieces provided by the libslab library
