General Info
------------
The mate-main-menu is a set of three utilities.  A mate-panel applet similar
to the traditional main-menu but a few addtions and changes.  In particular the
mate-main-menu does not provide direct access to all the applications on the
system, but rather displays user specified "favorites" and recently launched
applications [1].

Access to all the applications is made through the second of the three
utilities, the application-browser, which is a larger format application than
that the traditional main-menu which is managed by the window manager to allow
for resizing, etc.

The final utility is the mate-control-center which is laid out exactly as the
application-browser, but providing access to all the system's configuration
utilities.

Both the application-browser and the mate-control-center are accessible
directly from the main-menu.

Installing
----------
A standard combination of ...

	./configure --prefix=<install_dir>
	make
	make install

should suffice.

*Note*  As for the "recently used applications" functionality, this requires
patched versions of mate-desktop and mate-panel.  These patches are available
in the patch subdir.

Usage
-----
After installing a "Mate Main Menu" applet should appear in your "Add to panel
..." dialog.
